"""
This script defines API endpoints for managing City objects.
It includes routes for getting a list of cities in a state,
getting a specific city by its ID, creating a new city in a state,
updating an existing city, and deleting a city.

The following routes are implemented:
- GET /states/<state_id>/cities:
    Returns a list of City objects associated with a state.
- GET /cities/<city_id>:
    Returns a specific City object by its ID.
- DELETE /cities/<city_id>:
    Deletes a City object by its ID.
- POST /states/<state_id>/cities:
    Creates a new City object associated with a state.
- PUT /cities/<city_id>:
    Updates a City object with the provided JSON data.

Each route has error handling for cases like non-existent state or city IDs,
missing or incorrect JSON data in the request, and attempts to modify
read-only attributes.

The script uses the Flask web framework, and the City and State
objects are managed by a storage system.
